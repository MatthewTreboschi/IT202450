Hey, my name is Matthew Treboschi

I am in the IT 202-450 class for
summer 2021. I'm sure you've realized I took this class already last
semester. I did well on the quizes, attended every class and didn't miss a
homework for the first few weeks. Sadly, I have *not* been productive in
quarantine. I've gone from 1-2 classes ahead in my curriculum to 3 classes
behind in my final year at NJIT. I did not complete the project though.
This semester will be different though. Quarantine is ending. I can use the
njit facilities to focus on my work. The information in this class is very
important. I could use the practice creating projects from scratch.
