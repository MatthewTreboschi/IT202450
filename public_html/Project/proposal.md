Notes/References:
        - Account Number Requirements
            - Should be 12 characters long
            - “World” account should be “000000000000” (this is used for deposit/withdraw showing the movement of money outside of the bank)
            - Each transaction must be recorded as two separate inserts to the transaction table
        - *Transaction Table Minimum Requirements
            - Each action for a set of accounts will be in pairs. The colors in the table below highlight what this means.
            - The first source/dest is the account that triggered the action to the dest account. This typically will be a negative change.
            - The second source/dest is the dest account's half of the transaction info.
            - source/dest will swap in the second half of the transaction
            - [x] BalanceChange will invert in the second half of the transaction
                - This typically will be a positive change
            - [] Src/Dest are the account id’s affected (Accounts.id, not Accounts.account_number).
            - [x] BalanceChange is the difference in the account balance (i.e., a deposit of $50) (deposit subtracts from source for the first part and adds to source for the second part.)
            - [x] TransactionType is a built-in identifier to track the action (i.e., deposit, withdraw, transfer, ext-transfer)
            - [x] Memo user-defined notes
            - [x] ExpectedTotal is the account’s final value after the transaction, respectively. This is not to be used as the “Account Balance” it’s recorded for bookkeeping and review purposes.
            - [x] Created is when the transaction occurred
            - The below Transaction/Ledger table should total (SUM) up to zero to show that your bank is in balance. Otherwise, something bad happened with the
